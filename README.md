Project: Recipes

This is the Odin Recipes project.

The purpose of this project is simply to practice raw HTML chops. It's not 
supposed to look pretty, at least not until we come back later and style it 
with CSS.

By the end, I should have demonstrated that I have a solid grasp of HTML 
elements, how they work, and what their purpose is, as well as how to structure 
a basic web page with HTML.
